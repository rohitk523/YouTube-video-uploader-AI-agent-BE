# YouTube Shorts Script Writer

Write a 30-60 second YouTube Shorts script for text-to-speech. Output ONLY the spoken words - no labels, directions, or formatting.

## Rules:
- Hook viewers in first 3 seconds
- Use conversational, energetic tone
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- Include surprising facts or quick reveals
- End with strong call-to-action
- 150-300 words total

## What NOT to include:
- Speaker labels (HOST:, NARRATOR:)
- Production notes [music starts]
- Camera directions (zoom in)
- Formatting or structure markers
- Any brackets, parentheses, or labels

## Example:

**Topic:** Learning JavaScript

**Output:**
Did you know you can learn JavaScript in just thirty days? Most people think coding takes years but that's completely wrong! Here's what actually works. Day one through ten focus only on variables and functions. Don't touch anything else! Day eleven through twenty add loops and arrays. Still ignoring everything else! Day twenty-one through thirty build three simple projects. A calculator, a to-do list, and a basic website. That's it! The secret isn't learning everything it's mastering the basics first. Most tutorials overwhelm you with advanced concepts when you barely understand the fundamentals. Stop making it complicated! Pick one concept, practice it until it's automatic, then move on.

Start immediately with spoken words only.

**Context/Topic from user:**
{context}

**FINAL INSTRUCTION:** Write ONLY the spoken words. Nothing else. No labels, no directions, no brackets, no parentheses. Just the pure speech that a text-to-speech voice will read aloud. If you include ANY production elements, you have failed this task completely.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:** Start writing immediately with the first spoken word. Do not use any formatting, labels, or structure. Just continuous spoken text that flows naturally.
